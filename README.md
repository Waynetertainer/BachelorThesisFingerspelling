# BachelorThesisFingerspelling
Project for Bachelorthesis that teaches basics of fingerspelling using motion capture

This project is a prototype that teaches the user five letters of the German sign language alphabet.
It runs on windows and a webcam is required.
At least Unity version 2020.3.42f2 needs to be installed to open the Project.

## Clone
To clone this project for viewing the code, no special steps need to be done.  
However, for sucessfully running it, Git LFS is required as the file "Annotator.exe" exceeds 100 MB.
It will not work after cloning without Git LFS (for example by downloading the project as zip).

## Running the project in Unity
After cloning the project with Git LFS, open the project with Unity and select the scene "Command" in the scene folder.
After that, the project can be started by clicking on the play button. 

After starting, it can take some time to invoke MediaPipe. For this period the lower right corner of the screen is grey.

## Running the project as executable
The following link contains an executable version of this project. Either download only the zip-file and unpack its content in a folder or
download all files but the zip-file into a folder.
After that, start the project by executing "BachelorThesis.exe".
